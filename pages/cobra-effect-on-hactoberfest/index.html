                Hacktoberfest
            </a>
            is an annual event that occurs every October held by Digital Ocean.
            The event encourages developers to submit Pull Requests to Open Source repositories and as a reward you earn
            a limited-edition T-shirt.<br>
            <r></r>
            Even though Digital Ocean has set up some
            <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details#quality" class="has-text-link">
                "Quality standards"</a>, it wasn't enough for stop the

            <h1 class="title">What went wrong?</h1>
            Right now it is a blame game, The tweets says it all began because of a YouTuber demonstrated how to do a
            PR, but he failed at doing a quality contribution.<br>
            But, This has happened in the past — every year around the same time (October) — GitHub gets flooded with
            spam PRs, and this was the reason Digital Ocean updated their rules for contribution.<br>
            <br>
            In the first glance, it seems that the YouTuber is at fault, Most of the PR Spam looks a lot like what he
            demonstrated. <i>(I am not linking the YouTube video here, it might get deleted by the time you read this
                article)</i><br><br>
            Searching GitHub for <a href="https://github.com/search?q=%22Amazing+Project%22&type=issues"
                class="has-text-link" target="_blank">"Amazing Project"</a>
            or <a href="https://github.com/search?q=%22Improve+Docs%22&type=issues" class="has-text-link">"Improve
                Docs"</a>
            (PR changes he demonstrated in his video) is being widely used for the PR spam!
            — here is an <a href="https://github.com/pinax/symposion/pull/189/files" class="has-text-link"
                target="_blank">example</a>.
            <br><br>
            But is he the only one responsible? No, the issue began with Digital Ocean Not being clear on what needs to
            be done to qualify.<br>
            Providing T-Shirts for PRs was not a good idea to begin with as it just screams the <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobra_effect" class="has-text-link" target="_blank"><b>Cobra
                    Effect</b></a> at their face!
            <br>
            <br><br>
            <h1 class="title">Anyone can whine, what's your solution?</h1>
            Before I get to my solution, see what GitHub proposed due to PR spam.<br>

            Very Microsoft-y way of tackling problems ;)<br>
            <br>
            ...Okay, I'll stop.<br><br>
            Here what can be done.<br>
            Digital Ocean could stop current way of Hacktoberfest. But instead they can do a proper hackathon which
            promotes free and open-source software.<br>
            Let the developers improve on some existing repositories or create one of their own on platform of their
            choice. But set a limiter on how many repositories are considered<br><br>
            Reward based on Quality of commits instead of quantity.<br>
            Labeling hactoberfest and mentioning digitalocean might help spread word about the hackaton, but it will
            eventually become a spam.<br>
            Instead, ask developers submit link to the contributed repositories and their username of developer's
            accounts to validate commits. If anyone starts spamming with meaningless commits, disqualify them immediately.<br><br>
            Will this stop the PR spam? Yes, to an extent. But the internet will never run out of spammers.
