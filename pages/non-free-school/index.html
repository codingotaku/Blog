                This article is not about current education system or what we can do to fix it, but it is one of a few
                things that can be done for a better education.</p>
            <br>
            Schools are the entry point for kids to see and know about the world they live in. It is the duty of
            teachers to make them understand what can be preferred as right and wrong.<br>
            In a way, a teacher can make student good or a bad member of the society through their teaching.<br>
            <br>


            Due to current pandemic, Students are forced to learn through online class rooms. It makes perfect sense —
            health and safety of students must be the highest priority right now.<br>
            What doesn't make sense is the use of tools and software in these classes, tools which are notoriously
            proved to be spying on people.<br>
            Programs like <a href="https://www.eff.org/wp/school-issued-devices-and-student-privacy" target="_blank"
                class="has-link-text">Google Classroom</a>, <a
                href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/1/21244058/google-meet-microsoft-teams-webex-personal-data-collection-privacy-policy-concerns"
                target="_blank" class="has-link-text">Microsoft Teams</a>, or <a
                href="https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/better-than-zoom-try-these-free-software-tools-for-staying-in-touch"
                target="_blank" class="has-link-text">Zoom</a> invite a potentially malicious third-party into the
            educational environment,
            This also increases the risk of society being depended on <a href="https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/"
                target="_blank" class="has-link-text">proprietary software</a>, software that denies its users their
            freedom.
            <br>
            <div class="box">
                Students will get familiar with these programs which they are forbidden to study, share, or modify. And
                they also get used to more of these kinds of programs and it will be hard for them to move on to
                something <a href="https://jitsi.org/jitsi-meet/" target="_blank" class="has-link-text">better</a> that
                respects user freedom and privacy.<br>
            </div>

            Almost all of us are a victim of this, we learned Microsoft Word instead of learning Word processing,
            Microsoft Excel instead of spreadsheet, <a
                href="https://fossbytes.com/heres-why-a-user-got-irritated-by-windows-10-and-installed-linux-mint/"
                target="_blank" class="has-link-text">A proprietary spying operating system</a> instead of <a
                href="https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html" target="_blank" class="has-link-text">one that
                respects users freedom</a>. So on and so forth.<br>
            We grew up with this, we learned more of these in our computer science classes, and became depended on them.
            When you get a job in a computer industry you naturally think of Amazon AWS and other fog(yeah, it is not
            cloud)
            services to do the job. Making you and the company depended on that proprietary service and also forcing you
            to obey their disrespectful terms and conditions.
            <br>
            Students learning programming must be taught to use self-hosting free services so that they understand what
            is going on in the backend, and potentially improve them to their needs.
            This will help them to be a better programmer and also to contribute to the free software. This can become a
            trend, and we could see a free world in the future when this is implemented!

                    “We call on school administrators at all levels to drop requirements for students to use proprietary
                    software to participate in a course, and to adopt a free software replacement for every nonfree
                    program being used. As students, teachers, parents, and concerned citizens, we stand together for
                    the following principles:”
                    <ul>
                        <li>It is an injustice to require students to sacrifice their freedom to proprietary software in
                            pursuit of an education.</li>
                        <li>Using free software in the classroom communicates the importance of values key to a free
                            society: sharing, social responsibility, and independence.</li>
                        <li>With its focus on study and collaboration, free software is far more suited to the spirit of
                            pedagogy than the dependence and abuse caused by proprietary software.</li>
