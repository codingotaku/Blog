            This blog and my main <a href="https://codingotaku.com" class="has-text-link" target="_blank">website</a>
            does not have analytics.
            Yes, they are hosted using GitHub pages (at the time of writing) and it captures vague traffic details for
            insights, but I am not talking about that. I don't check those anyway...<br>
            <br>
            My reason to not use analytics was not for technical or moral reasons. There are analytics available right
            now that captures details in truly anonymous way and I chose to not use those either.<br>
            <br>
            <div class="content">
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If I had few readers, it would discourage me and I would find it difficult to continue writing.
                    </li>
                    <li>If some of my posts gets more attention, I will probably start writing things similar to those
                        posts.</li>
                    <li>If I had many readers who spend time on my blogs then I would potentially think that I am some
                        kind of celebrity who is followed by many, which I am obviously not.</li>
                </ul>
            </div><br>

            There are other moral reasons for me to include them, but the above list came up first to me and the choice was obvious.
