            Software is <b>not</b> like making a car. Once you've made one copy of your software, the production costs
            to make a
            million more are tiny<br>
            (there's a reason Microsoft has so many billions in the bank).
        </div>
        It <i>does</i> make sense to pay/donate a little to the people who developed your favorite OS, but the amount
        should be tiny, not 100s of Dollars.<br><br>
        <b>But that is just in cost perspective, there are other moral and ethical reasons for you to stay away from
            these
            Operating systems.</b><br><br>

            is a privacy nightmare

            not care about user freedom!
        </a><br><br>
        But don't worry, There are other operating systems which exists which is free and much better. One alternative
        is GNU/Linux and this is the only Operating system I know which cares about user freedom.<br>
        You can get a list of GNU/Linux Operating systems from
        <a href="https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html" class="has-text-link" target="_blank">here</a>.
        <br><a href="https://pureos.net/" class="has-text-link" target="_blank">PureOS</a>
        is a fully free GNU/Linux distribution based on Debian and will probably suit your needs.
        <br><br>
        <i>Personally I feel debian can be used as long as you don't install anything
            from its non-free repository. I use it in my main system and it works great!
        </i><br><br>

        But what if you just came from Windows or Mac and you want the OS to "Just Work" and install whatever you want?
        There are other GNU/Linux operating systems exists which are
        <a href="https://www.gnu.org/distros/common-distros.html" class="has-text-link" target="_blank">
            not fully free
        </a>.<br>
        These non-free distributions came with the cost of your freedom, but much less compared to the other two
        mainstream desktop
        operating systems.
