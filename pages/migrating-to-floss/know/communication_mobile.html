        <strong>Communication must not be done in a walled garden</strong>, using protocols instead of apps makes sure that you can
        talk to anyone regardless of the app they use. This is the main reason I ask people to switch to <a
            href="https://element.io/" class="has-text-link">Element</a>.<br>
        Element works with all Matrix-based apps and bridges into proprietary messengers too. <br><br>

        Signal is another candidate, but I am adding it here half-heartedly. Unlike Element, using it with other apps
        will be a hassle right now and
        requires you to use your phone number to create an account. Signal app does not exist in f-droid and the
        developer has been hesitant to do so for many years (here is one <a
            href="https://whispersystems.discoursehosting.net/t/how-to-get-signal-apks-outside-of-the-google-play-store/808/20"
            class="has-text-link">instance</a>).<br>
        The Signal clients and server does support federation, it is just a matter of time before it becomes fully
        federated. It is said to get a phone number free feature in the future and until then theoretically one could
        use a burner number for it.<br><br>

        Telegram also raise some concerns as the chat is not default end-to-end encrypted and requires you to identify
        yourself with your number.
        The encryption is done on the server side with their own solution. User will have to just "Trust" the maintainers, so I
        recommend you to use Telegram only if you need to part of a public channel - not for secure messaging.<br><br>

        But these are much better in terms of privacy and security compared to the mainstream applications.<br><br>
        There is a widespread misconception that WhatsApp is secure and privacy-friendly.
        While WhatsApp can’t see what’s inside the messages, they can see your activities, who is
        sending a message to
        whom and when - which is a large risk (read more on their policies from the links
        below).<br><br>
        And according to the WhatsApp <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/?_fb_noscript=1" class="has-text-link"
            target="_blank">privacy policy</a>, <strong>the company reserves the
            right to record this
            information, known as message metadata, and share information with <span
                class="has-text-danger">"others"</span> including(<span class="has-text-danger">but
                obviously not limited to</span>) law enforcement and to respond to legal
            requests.</strong>
        If you use their service, please check their statements regularly.<br>
        They also design the privacy policy page in a way that it is hard to point to a section of their
        statement through links.<br>
        Details on information shared to law enforcement can be found <a
            href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/information-for-law-enforcement-authorities?_fb_noscript=1"
            class="has-text-link" target="_blank">here</a>.
        <br><br>
        Facebook Messenger is even cruel in terms of privacy, I could not find a privacy policy for
        their messenger app, the best I could find is <a href="https://www.messenger.com/privacy" class="has-text-link"
            target="_blank">this</a>. I will just assume that it has the same <a
            href="https://www.facebook.com/full_data_use_policy" class="has-text-link" target="_blank">policies</a> as
        Facebook.

        <a href="https://hike.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/230607627-Privacy-Policy" class="has-text-link"
            target="_blank">Hike</a>,
        and <a href="https://terms.line.me/line_rules/" class="has-text-link" target="_blank">Line</a> follows the
        same trend.<br><br>
