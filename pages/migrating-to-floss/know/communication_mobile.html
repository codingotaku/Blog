        There is a widespread misconception that WhatsApp is secure and privacy friendly.
        While WhatsApp can’t see what’s inside the messages, they can see your activities, who is
        sending a message to
        whom and when - which is a large risk (read more on their policies from the links
        below).<br><br>
        And according to the WhatsApp <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/?_fb_noscript=1" class="has-text-link"
            target="_blank">privacy policy</a>, <strong>the company reserves the
            right to record this
            information, known as message metadata, and share information with <span
                class="has-text-danger">"others"</span> including(<span class="has-text-danger">but
                obviously not limited to</span>) law enforcement and to respond to legal
            requests.</strong>
        If you use their service, please check their statements regularly.<br>
        They also design the privacy policy page in a way that it is hard to point to a section of their
        statement through links.<br>
        Details on information shared to law enforcement can be found <a

        Facebook messenger is even cruel in terms of privacy, I could not find a privacy policy for
        their messenger app, the best I could find is <a href="https://www.messenger.com/privacy" class="has-text-link"
            target="_blank">this</a>. I will just assume that it has the same <a
            href="https://www.facebook.com/full_data_use_policy" class="has-text-link" target="_blank">policies</a> as
        Facebook.
