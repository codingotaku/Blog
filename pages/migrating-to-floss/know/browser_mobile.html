        I did not add Chromium and other browsers based on it in this list purposefully. It has some
        of Google bloats that
        needs to be removed and some folks have made <a href="https://ungoogled-software.github.io/about/"
            class="has-text-link" target="_blank">ungoogled chromium</a> for that specific purpose.<br>
        But user needs to add an extra <a
            href="https://git.droidware.info/wchen342/ungoogled-chromium-android#user-content-f-droid-repository"
            class="has-text-link" target="_blank">unofficial repo</a> to F-Droid to install
        this.<br><br>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebKit" class="has-text-link" target="_blank">WebKit</a>
        engine based browsers are <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1101350" class="has-text-link"
            target="_blank">forced onto iPhone users</a>, Apples policy does
        not allow developers to develop a browser that is not based on their tool (Another reason to
        stay away from Apple).
        <br><br>
        While
        <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/mobile/" class="has-text-link" target="_blank">
            Firefox
        </a> source code from the Mozilla project is free
        software, they distribute and recommend nonfree software as plug-ins and addons. Also their
        trademark license imposes requirements for the distribution of modified versions that make
        it inconvenient to exercise freedom 3.<br><br>
        <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.mozilla.fennec_fdroid/" class="has-text-link" target="_blank">
            Fennec F-Droid
        </a> is based on the latest Firefox
        release. It's focused on removing any
        proprietary bits found in official Mozilla's builds. There might still be some binaries left
        and the app (or some builds) might get removed or re-pushed anytime.<br><br>
        But Fennec is also not fully Free-- it is just a variant of firefox without the binary
        blobs.
        This is the reason why
        <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.gnu.icecat/" class="has-text-link" target="_blank">
            IceCatMobile
        </a> was developed.
        IceCatMobile is a Browser using the Gecko layout engine to render web pages, which
        implements current and anticipated web standards. This is a free software rebranding of the
        latest Firefox-ESR release.

        Another option is the Tor Browser, though it is
        <a href="https://support.torproject.org/tormobile/tormobile-7/" class="has-text-link" target="_blank">not in
            official F-Droid repo yet</a>, you can enable the
        <a href="https://guardianproject.info/fdroid/" class="has-text-link" target="_blank">Guardian
            Project Official App Repository
        </a> in F-Droid to install it.
