        The pocket world is filled with <a href="/pages/india-chinese-app-ban/" class="has-text-link"
            target="_blank">spyware</a>, but if you are an Android user
        you can
        install custom rom to avoid all proprietary apps and
        services! F-Droid is a
        repo for FLOSS Android Applications<br><br>
        Sorry iOS users, you threw away that freedom when you choose Apple. You could still sideload
        apps
        with <a href="https://github.com/rileytestut/AltStore" class="has-text-link" target="_blank">AltStore</a>
        <i>(there are other stores available now)</i> without <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_jailbreaking"
            class="has-text-link" target="_blank">jailbreaking</a>.
        But it is not a FLOSS repo like F-Droid.
        <br><br>
        The <a href="https://f-droid.org" target="_blank" class="has-text-link">
            F-Droid</a> Repository is an easily-installable catalogue of free and open source apps
        for Android. With F-Droid, it's easy to browse and install apps on your device, and keep
        track of updates. You can also browse the repository with a web browser, and download the
        app directly from there, if you can’t or don’t want to run the F-Droid client on your
        device.<br><br>
        <div class="notification is-success">
            All applications in the default F-Droid repository must be Free and Open Source software – for
            example, released under a GPL or Apache license. Every effort is made to verify that
            this is actually the case, both by visual inspection of the source, and by building the
            application from the published source.
        </div><br>
        Software that reports user activity without permission (e.g. via Google Analytics) or tracks
        user behavior (e.g. most advertising platforms) is specifically excluded from F-Droid’s own
        repository, as is software with the primary purpose of interacting with a non-Free network
        service. You are, of course, free to set up your own repository for this kind of software –
        the server source is available, and the client will allow addition or removal of
        repositories as you see fit.
