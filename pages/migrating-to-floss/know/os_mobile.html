        iOS also restricts user freedom just like Mac OS, <a
            href="https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/malware-apple.html#jails" class="has-text-link" target="_blank">The
            users are kept in a jail</a> with
        less
        access to the free world.
        It is basically same as Mac OS in terms of user freedom.<br>
        I Do not recommend anyone to use Apple products if you wish to have a private
        life.
        They
        might promise you security but it is impossible for you to verify them unless
        they
        provide you with the source code which can reproduce their build.

        There are no good alternatives for Android, if you install the malwares such as
        <span class="tag is-danger">Google Play Services</span> or <span class="tag is-danger">Playstore</span> you will
        compromise your setup.
        Sadly these comes built-in with almost all mobiles.<br><br>

            This is the reason I promote custom roms like <a href="https://www.lineageos.org" class="has-text-link"
                target="_blank">LineageOS</a> and <a href="https://omnirom.org/" class="has-text-link"
                target="_blank">OmniRom</a>
            instead. The official guide
            asks you to install GApps (Google apps),
            but if you avoid it and install <a href="http://f-droid.org/" class="has-text-link"
                target="_blank">F-Droid</a> instead of playstore,
            you
            are good to go.

        <i>You can always buy <a href="https://puri.sm/products/librem-5/" class="has-text-link">Librem
                5</a> or <a href="https://www.pine64.org/pinephone/" class="has-text-link" target="_blank">Pinephone</a>
            if you wish to have a <span class="tag is-success">GNU/Linux system in your pocket</span><br>
            But they are not yet a full fledged mobile and needs a lot of improvements
            in
            terms
            of performance.</i>
