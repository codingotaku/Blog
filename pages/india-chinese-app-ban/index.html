      <div class="notification is-danger content">Disclaimer: This blog was written in frustration, the tone and content
        might offend some of you, but I guarantee you that it is NOT NSFW. But it's a bit political. I tried to avoid as many accusations as possible here.<br>
      </div><br><br>

      <p class="notification">It's rather inconvenient when something that you use every day stops working all of a
        sudden. It's even more inconvenient when you know that it may never work again for you.<br>
        Then you start finding <a href="https://alternativeto.net" class="has-text-link"

        found.<br></p>

        Recently a handful of apps <a class="has-text-link"
          href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetailm.aspx?PRID=1635206#" target="_blank">banned in India</a> for “being
        engaged in activities prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of the nation“

        <div class="column content">
          From this list of apps that were banned, I have used ES File explorer in the past, also played Mobile Legends,
          and have tried Bigo Live for a couple of days and uninstalled it.<br>
          <div class="box has-text-danger">When I say past, I mean my young self who thought everything that's famous is
            cool and trendy!<br></div>
          ES wasn't bad before it got bought by another money hungry corporate and filled it with advertisements,
          Mobile legends was a cool game for time pass until levelling up gets harder without purchasing stuff.
          And "bigo live" was an eyesore.<br>
          <br>
          I am glad for these apps to be removed from the public use, <strong>but they were banned for the wrong
            reason,</strong> a political move <strong>against</strong> China.<br><br>
          <div class="box">
            These banned list of apps are a threat to all of its users and their privacy. People make a nation, and any
            threat to the
            people ARE what defines a threat for the nation.<br>

            But, there are tons more of apps in the store which are even more troublesome. Which tracks your daily life

        These and more are the data being collected by the apps that you use daily, <strong
          class="has-text-danger">every service that you use has answer for at least one of these
          questions</strong>.<br>
        All of it combined can provide a detailed profile of you that even you didn't know of.
        And all of them are <strong>connected</strong> in ways that a normal user is not aware or even thought
        of.<br><br>
        <div class="notification is-info">
          Don't take my word for it, install a script blocker like <a href="https://noscript.net/"
            class="has-text-white" target="_blank">noscript</a>, go to your favorite websites,
          <strong>even banking websites</strong> and check the scripts being blocked (and allowed). The horrible trio
          (Google, Facebook,
          and Amazon) analytics can be found everywhere! And there will be more unnecessory ads+tracking embedded to
          most
          of them.
        </div>
        <div class="box">
          People who know about it said <strong>“Company X knows everything about you!“</strong> and it became a meme,
          others laughs about it and moved on without realizing how much of their privacy is at stake.
        </div>
        Making a website with <a href="https://vanilla-js.com/" class="has-text-link" target="_blank">VanilaJS</a> is
        not hard (look at this website source code for example).
        Web development is my primary job, I do a good enough job of it without using all the bloted <a
          href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html" target="_blank" class="has-text-link">non-free
          scripts</a> that consumes your bandwidth and privacy.
        <p><br>
        <div class="box">
          If I say “privacy“ most people would say <label class="has-text-danger">“who cares? They will just use it for
            advertisements, I'm fine with those, and I can just block them with yada yada yada“</label>,<br>
          you forget that when a company sell your info, <strong>it can also go to anyone</strong>, including their
          government and it could also be yours.<br><br>

          Usually the cover up for this massive threat is the sentence <strong class="has-text-danger">“As applicable by
            law“</strong> somewhere in the privacy policy and third party data collection section.<br>
        </div>
        <div class="box notification has-text-danger">
          Now people are worried when a Chinese app has a similar sentence in their policy. But isn't it the same for
          almost every other service that you use? And how many of you have realized that?<br><br>
          A good example will be the <a href="https://www.privacytools.io/providers/#ukusa" class="has-text-link"
            target="_blank">Global Mass Surveillance</a> and <a href="https://www.privacytools.io/providers/#kdl"
            class="has-text-link" target="_blank">Key Disclosure Laws</a> (check if your country is in the list, if
          found,
          stop using all services from that country).
        </div>
        </p><br>

        I am attempting to put and end to this, and there are millions of others with the same thought process as
        mine.<br>
        To avoid a privacy leak of you, your family, your neighborhood, AND your nation, what you can do is very
        simple.<br><br>
        <div class="box">
          You don't have to rebel against anything. You don't have to go on a riot and throw everything into flames, you
          don't have to blame the current or previous government,<br>
          before installing anything to your system, before browsing your favorite shopping site,<span
            class="has-text-info"> go to <a href="https://alternativeto.net" class="has-text-link"
              target="_blank">https://alternativeto.net</a><br>
            search for that privacy invasive program, filter it by open-source and the device that you use. <a
              href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html" class="has-text-link" target="_blank">Free and Open
              source software (Free as in freedom)</a> will not be able to collect your data.</span><br><br>
          Because the source code is public, and anyone can verify any malicious code going into it. I like this phrase
          <strong>“Dance like no one's watching. Encrypt like everyone is!“</strong>, which can ONLY be achieved by a
          Free and Open-Source Software.<br>
        </div>
        <br>
        There are other sites like <a href="https://privacytools.io" target="_blank"
          class="has-text-link">privacytools.io</a> which is made by the community for the community for enhanced
        privacy of all.<br>
        <br>
        Once you start using them, <strong>spread the word</strong> like the same way you used to. you might find your
        life to be a bit peaceful one you get rid of proprietary software and services. <br>
        <br>
        Be safe.<br>
