        sudden.<br>
        It's even more inconvenient when you know that it may never work again for you.<br>
        Then you start finding <a href="https://alternativeto.net" class="has-text-link"

        found.<br></p>
      <p class="notification is-warning">
        Recently a handful of apps were <a class="has-text-link"
          href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetailm.aspx?PRID=1635206#" target="_blank">banned in India</a> for "being

        From this list of apps that were banned, I have used ES File explorer in the past, also played Mobile Legends,
        and have tried Bigo Live for a couple of days and uninstalled it.<br>
        <div class="box has-text-info">When I say past, I mean my young self who thought everything that's famous is
          cool and trendy!<br></div>
        ES wasn't bad before it got bought by another corporate and filled it with advertisements, Mobile legends was a
        cool game for time pass until levelling up gets harder without purchasing stuff. And "bigo live" was an
        eyesore.<br>
        <br>
        I am glad for these apps to be removed from the public use, <strong>but they were banned for the wrong
          reason.</strong><br>
        <div class="box">
          These apps are a threat to all of its users and their privacy. People make a nation, and any threat to the
          people ARE what defines a threat for the nation.<br>

          DO YOU YELL A LOT in comments for no reason? <i class="has-text-info">(I stopped adding links after a while,
            you can search them on your own, it's not hard to find news on these)</i>.</div>
        <br>
        These and more are the data being collected by the apps that you use daily, <strong
          class="has-text-danger">every service that you use has answer for at least one of these questions</strong>.
        And all of it combined
        can provide a detailed picture of you that even you didn't know of. And all of them are
        <strong>connected</strong> in ways that a normal user is not aware or even thought of.<br>
        <div class="box">
          People who know about it said <strong>"Company X knows everything about you!"</strong> and it became a meme,
          others laughs about it and moved on without realizing how much of their privacy is at stake.
        </div>
        <p>
        <div class="box">
          If I say "privacy" most people would say <label class="has-text-danger">"who cares? They will just use it for
            advertisements, I'm fine with those, and I can just block them with yada yada yada"</label>,<br>
          you forget that when a company sell your info, <strong>it can also go to anyone</strong>, including their
          government and it could also be yours.<br><br>

          Usually the cover up for this massive threat is the sentence <strong class="has-text-danger">"As applicable by
            law"</strong> somewhere in the privacy policy and third party data collection section.<br>
        </div>
        <div class="box notification is-danger">
          Now people are worried when a Chinese app has a similar sentence in their policy. But isn't it the same for
          almost every other service that you use? And how many of you have realized that?
        </div>
        </p><br>

        I am attempting to put and end to this, and there are millions of others with the same thought process as
        mine.<br>
        To avoid a privacy leak of you, your family, your neighbourhood, AND your nation, what you can do is very
        simple.<br><br>
        <div class="box">
          You don't have to rebel against anything. You don't have to go on a riot and throw everything into flames, you
          don't have to blame the current or previous government,<br>
          before installing anything to your system, before browsing your favourite shopping site,<span
            class="has-text-info"> go to <a href="https://alternativeto.net" class="has-text-link"
              target="_blank">https://alternativeto.net</a><br>
            search for that privacy invasive program, filter it by open-source and the device that you use. <a
              href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html" class="has-text-link" target="_blank">Free and Open
              source software (Free as in freedom)</a> will not be able to collect your data.</span><br><br>
          Because the source code is public, and anyone can verify any malicious code going into it. I like this phrase
          <strong>"Dance like no one's watching. Encrypt like everyone is!"</strong>, which can ONLY be achived by a
          Free and Open-Source Software.<br>
        </div>
        <br>
        There are other sites like <a href="https://privacytools.io" target="_blank"
          class="has-text-link">privacytools.io</a> which is made by the community for the community for enhanced
        privacy of all.<br>
        <br>
        Once you start using them, <strong>spread the word</strong> like the same way you used to. you might find your
        life to be a bit peaceful one you get rid of proprietary software and services. <br>
        <br>
        Be safe.<br>
