            <p>Assume that a new version of internet is created. Where everyone has their mind connected to each other
                for information sharing.
                <br>It does not share your personal information or anything that can even remotely
                identify you, but it shares knowledge on the things that has been made before.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Imagine not having to learn things that has already been done! Your mind is already connected to an open
                internet of human brains which already has the information you seek.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                You can just download the information directly to your brain and use it like you have already learned
                it!
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Now you can focus your attention on new innovations, but kids still has to go to school for learning how
                to use the knowledge the right way!

                But I received question from <a href="https://fosstodon.org/web/statuses/102086437791889565"

                "How are you sure it's open? It could be a totalitarian's
                dream to have everyone's mind combined, recorded, analyzed, manipulated, controlled."
            </div>
            <p>
                It is a bit of stretch, the only way to keep it open is to make sure that it is maintained by a
                community, and also making sure that whatever they do during maintenance is also part of the knowledge
                that's being shared. Maybe we can make sure that no political or proprietary information is available...
                (only science and logic is shared). Any who, I was just talking about downloading the information not
                analyzing, manipulating or controlling users... I need to work on my communication skills.

                I did not give much thought about the technical and moral stuff! But any suggestions are welcome to make
                this
                fantasy-open-brain-network-thingy more open!

                When the Internet was first to come out, there were the same expectations, but obviously it doesn't come
                out the way as we expected.
            </div>
            <p> True, internet and IOT (trust me, IOT were on paper with good intentions) are not what they are supposed
                to be, but I don't think that the problem was with just the internet or the people who used it for
                gathering personal information.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Things went south because of lack of knowledge and ignorance of educated folks.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                We could learn from their mistakes and TRY to create something better, or keep whining about what we
                have without contributing anything to it.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                What could be the future? It is what we decide. It doesn't matter whether the technology is created by a
                massive corporation or a nonprofit organization, the only thing matter is what you
                do with the technology and the intentions behind it.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                So if we have somehow created the Open-Brain-Internet-Thingy (I should have thought of a name) It is
                guaranteed to be misused, and made profit with. No exceptions, it WILL happen.<br><br>
                If GPL violations come to an end, we can release this technology and it's complete source code under a
                valid GPL License!
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                How do we prevent it? How do we know that the <b>*holds my breath*</b> Open-Brain-Internet-Thingy is not
                used to control what we think? The intention was to create a way for our humanity to advance by
                eliminating redundant work. But it is now forked and cloned by multiple massive corporations with
                service fees and targeted advertisements but with benefits of having more accurate data! What will you
                choose? What is wrong with us as humanity to make a profit out of learning? To add 80 different layers
                DRM to knowledge that should be publicly available?

                        some
                        misinformation as it is mostly added by community, the topics that you learned might be tracked

                        targeted advertisements which will be transmitted to you while you learn new topics! — Costs
